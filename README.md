# Personality Prediction: Introversion vs. Extroversion

An exploratory data science and machine learning project focused on predicting an individual's personality type (introvert or extrovert) based on behavioral data.

## üåü Project Overview

This repository explores the fascinating challenge of classifying personality types using machine learning. The project utilizes a supervised classification approach to build a model that can predict whether a person is an introvert or an extrovert. The core of the project involves:

- Data Collection & Cleaning: Gathering data from sources like surveys, social media activity, or behavioral logs, and then cleaning it for analysis.

- Feature Engineering: Extracting meaningful features from the raw data that are indicative of introverted or extroverted traits (e.g., frequency of social interactions, type of content shared).

- Model Training & Evaluation: Training various classification models to predict the target variable and evaluating their performance to determine the most effective approach.

The project relies on a dataset containing labeled behavioral data. The data should include a target variable for personality type and various features that could be used for prediction. Potential features might include:

- Survey responses: Answers to psychological questionnaires (e.g., Myers-Briggs Type Indicator or Big Five personality test).

- Online activity: Time spent on social media, number of connections, or engagement with different types of content.

- Communication patterns: Frequency of communication, use of emojis, or length of messages.

- Demographic information: Age, gender, and occupation.
